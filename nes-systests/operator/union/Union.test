# Todo: BUG
# - both sources get the same FormatScan pipeline as their successor
# - two TupleBuffers, both with sequence number 1 end up in the input formatter pipeline
# - Two major problems:
# - 1: violates assumption that sequence numbers are unique in a pipeline
# - 2: raw buffers should not share the same format pipeline, since formatting the individual raw buffers is unrelated
# Solution: two format pipelines

# Simple Union
